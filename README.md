For 12.45 we moved the last twp methods from the Fox Class to the Animal Class. 
The next thing we did was we provided accesor and mutator methods for the foxes and rabbits.

12.46
For this quetion we moved the canBreed method that was there originally in the subclass to the superclass.
Then we created the getBreedingAge for Fox and Rabbit.

12.47
Next I moved the increment age method from the subclasses to the superclass. 
I also created the abtract methods for methods like getMaxAge in the Animal class
then I wrote the concrete method inside the body for methods like getMaxAge.

12.48
In this excercise we were able to move the breed method to Animal.

12.51
For this final question we created the subclass Wolf for Animal after that I copied what was there in the Fox Class into the Wolf Class.
I then had to modify the code for the animal class because I added the new class.
